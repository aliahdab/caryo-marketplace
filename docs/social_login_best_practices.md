# Social Login Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for implementing and maintaining social login functionality in the Caryo Marketplace application.

## General Best Practices

### 1. Security Considerations

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments to protect OAuth tokens and user data.
- **Token Validation**: Thoroughly validate all tokens received from OAuth providers.
- **Securely Store Credentials**: Never hardcode OAuth client IDs and secrets; use environment variables.
- **Limit Scope**: Request only the permissions you need from users.
- **Account Linking**: Consider allowing users to link multiple social accounts to one application account.
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement state parameters in OAuth flows to prevent CSRF attacks.

### 2. User Experience

- **Clear Branding**: Clearly display provider logos and follow their branding guidelines.
- **Seamless Flow**: Minimize redirects and clicks required to complete authentication.
- **Fallback Options**: Always provide traditional login options alongside social login.
- **Error Messages**: Display helpful error messages when social login fails.
- **Account Creation Transparency**: Clearly communicate when a new account is being created.

### 3. Implementation

- **Handling Name Collisions**: Have a strategy for handling username conflicts when auto-generating usernames.
- **Email Verification**: Consider whether email verification is still necessary with social login.
- **Profile Data Synchronization**: Decide when and how to synchronize user profile data from social providers.
- **Sessions & Tokens**: Manage session lifetime and token refreshing appropriately.

## Provider-Specific Considerations

### Google OAuth

- **Keep Libraries Updated**: Google frequently updates their authentication libraries; stay current.
- **Track API Changes**: Monitor Google's developer blog for authentication API changes.
- **Handle Account Types**: Be aware that Google accounts can be personal, workspace, or educational accounts with different behaviors.
- **JWT Validation**: Use Google's libraries for validating JWTs when possible.

### Other Providers (Future Implementation)

- **Facebook**: Requires regular app review to maintain extended permissions.
- **Apple**: Required if you offer other social login options and deploy on Apple platforms.
- **Twitter**: Consider implications of X rebranding and platform changes.

## Testing

- **Test Regularly**: Social login providers can change their APIs without notice; test regularly.
- **Mock Providers**: Use mocks in automated tests rather than making real authentication calls.
- **Test Edge Cases**: Test account linking, unlinking, and provider downtime scenarios.
- **Multiple Test Accounts**: Maintain test accounts for each social provider.

## Maintaining Social Login

- **Monitor Usage**: Track which social login providers are most popular among your users.
- **Provider Status Pages**: Monitor status pages of social login providers for outages.
- **Update OAuth Consent Screens**: Regularly review and update your OAuth consent screens.
- **Respond to Policy Changes**: Social platforms frequently change their policies; be prepared to adapt.

## Handling Account Merging

When a user attempts to login with a social account that matches an email address already in your system:

1. **Detection**: Identify when an incoming social login matches an existing email.
2. **User Flow**: Either:
   - Automatically connect the accounts if the user is already logged in
   - Prompt the user to login with their existing account first, then offer to connect accounts
   - Send a verification email to confirm account ownership before merging
3. **Data Reconciliation**: Have a policy for handling conflicting data between accounts.

## Documentation

- **User Documentation**: Provide clear instructions for users on how to use social login.
- **Internal Documentation**: Document the implementation details for developers.
- **Tracking Changes**: Keep a record of any changes to your social login implementation.

## Compliance

- **Terms of Service**: Ensure your application's terms of service cover data received through social login.
- **Privacy Policy**: Update your privacy policy to explain how you use data from social providers.
- **GDPR Considerations**: Be aware of how social login affects your GDPR compliance.
- **Data Deletion**: Have a process for completely removing user data when requested.
