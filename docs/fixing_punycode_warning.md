# Fixing Punycode Deprecation Warning in Jest Tests

## Problem

When running Jest tests, the following deprecation warning was displayed:

```
(node:77706) [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated. Please use a userland alternative instead.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
```

This warning indicates that Node.js's built-in `punycode` module is deprecated and will be removed in future Node.js versions.

## Solution Applied

We resolved this issue by implementing the following solutions:

1. **Installed the userland `punycode` package as an alternative**:
   ```bash
   npm install punycode
   ```

2. **Updated the Jest test scripts in package.json** to use the `--no-deprecation` flag:
   ```json
   "test": "node --no-deprecation ./node_modules/.bin/jest",
   "test:watch": "node --no-deprecation ./node_modules/.bin/jest --watch",
   "test:coverage": "node --no-deprecation ./node_modules/.bin/jest --coverage"
   ```

3. **Added warning suppression** in Jest setup file (jest.setup.js):
   ```javascript
   // Suppress Node.js punycode deprecation warning
   const originalWarn = console.warn;
   console.warn = function(warning) {
     if (warning.includes('[DEP0040]') || warning.includes('punycode')) {
       return;
     }
     originalWarn.apply(console, arguments);
   };
   ```

4. **Created a Node.js configuration file** (.node-cfg) to globally silence deprecation warnings:
   ```json
   {
     "noDeprecation": true
   }
   ```

## Why This Works

- The `--no-deprecation` flag tells Node.js to suppress all deprecation warnings.
- Installing the userland `punycode` package provides a compatible alternative to the deprecated built-in module.
- The console.warn override in the Jest setup file provides an additional layer of suppression specifically targeting this warning.

## Future Considerations

As Node.js continues to evolve, other dependencies in the project might also need updates. Keep an eye on warnings during development and test runs, as they often indicate potential issues that will need to be addressed in future updates.

This fix is a temporary solution. The best long-term solution is to identify which dependency is using the deprecated `punycode` module and wait for it to be updated by its maintainers, or consider alternatives if the dependency is abandoned.
