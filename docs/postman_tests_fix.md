# Postman API Tests Fix Report

## Issue Identified
The main issue causing the Postman API tests to fail was a path inconsistency in the Postman collection files. Specifically:

1. The Spring Security configuration in your application permits `/api/auth/**` endpoints, making them publicly accessible.
2. However, in the main `autotrader-api-collection.json` file, there was a mismatch between:
   - The `raw` URL which correctly specified `/api/auth/signup` and `/api/auth/signin`
   - The `path` array which incorrectly specified just `["auth", "signup"]` and `["auth", "signin"]` (missing the `api` segment)

This inconsistency was causing the requests to be sent to the wrong path (`/auth/signup` instead of `/api/auth/signup`), which resulted in 404 errors or authentication failures.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Fixed Postman Collection Paths**:
   - Updated the path arrays in `autotrader-api-collection.json` to include the `api` segment, ensuring both raw URL and path array match
   - This ensures that Newman correctly sends requests to `/api/auth/*` endpoints instead of `/auth/*` endpoints

2. **Enhanced Diagnostic Tools**:
   - Updated `diagnose-user-auth.sh` to check both `/auth/*` and `/api/auth/*` endpoints
   - Created a new diagnostic script `test-auth-paths.sh` to compare both paths and identify which one works correctly
   - Modified the GitHub workflow to run these diagnostics if tests fail

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Created this summary explaining the issue and solution

## Testing & Verification

You can verify the fix works by:

1. Running the workflow manually through GitHub Actions
2. Testing locally with the following commands:
   ```bash
   cd backend/autotrader-backend
   ./gradlew bootRun &
   # Wait for application to start
   cd ../..
   bash scripts/test-auth-paths.sh
   ```

## Future Recommendations

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Standardize API Path Patterns**: Ensure all API paths follow the same pattern (e.g., always use `/api/` prefix)
2. **Collection Maintenance**: Regularly run Postman collections locally to verify they work before pushing changes
3. **Path Validation**: Add a step to your CI process to validate Postman collection paths against your API documentation

## Additional Notes

If you still encounter issues, there could be other authentication-related problems. Check:
- Your Spring Security configuration might need additional adjustments
- The Postman environment file might need to be updated with correct baseUrl or auth tokens
- There could be CORS issues preventing client access

The diagnostic scripts will help identify these issues if they arise.
