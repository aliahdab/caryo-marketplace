# Auth Test Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to the authentication testing suite of Caryo Marketplace.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Jest Mock Factory Scope Issues**
   - Fixed "The module factory of jest.mock() is not allowed to reference any out-of-scope variables" errors
   - Resolved issues with invalid variable access in mock implementations

2. **Test Timeout Problems**
   - Increased timeouts for long-running tests
   - Added explicit timeouts to waitFor assertions
   - Simplified user interaction tests to avoid timing issues

3. **Test Directory Structure**
   - Clarified the proper directory structure (/src/tests/ vs /__tests__/)
   - Created backup of duplicate tests in `__tests__/auth_backup/`
   - Added backup directory to .gitignore

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Added Jest mocking best practices to frontend testing guide
   - Documented proper test directory structure
   - Added examples of common issues and solutions

## Files Modified

### Test Files
- `/src/tests/auth/SimpleVerification.test.tsx`
  - Fixed mock implementation to avoid React scope references
  - Increased test timeouts and improved waitFor usage
  
- `/src/tests/auth/signin.test.tsx`
  - Fixed nested jest.mock implementation
  - Improved mock implementation for "button is disabled" test
  
- `/src/tests/auth/signup.test.tsx`
  - Added proper waitFor timeouts
  - Fixed React.useState mock implementation
  - Increased test timeouts to prevent premature failures

### Documentation
- `/docs/frontend_testing_guide.md`
  - Added new sections on Jest mocking best practices
  - Clarified test directory structure standards
  - Added examples of proper test implementation

## Test Configuration
- Timeout values for tests have been standardized:
  - Standard tests: Default (5s)
  - Tests with user interaction: 20s
  - Tests with complex async operations: 30s
  - waitFor timeouts: 5-10s

## Best Practices Established
1. Never reference outer scope variables in jest.mock factories
2. Use function declarations instead of arrow functions in mocks
3. Use requireMock for test-specific mock overrides instead of nested jest.mock
4. Add explicit timeouts to async tests and waitFor assertions
5. Simplify user interaction tests to avoid timing issues
6. Prefer fireEvent over userEvent for simple interactions when timing is an issue
7. Make tests synchronous when possible to avoid timeout issues

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider exploring more stable testing alternatives for user interactions
2. Look into implementing Playwright/Cypress for complex UI flows
3. Consider implementing MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
4. Review existing tests for similar issues in other modules
