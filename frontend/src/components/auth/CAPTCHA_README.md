# CAPTCHA Functionality Removed

As of May 2025, the CAPTCHA verification functionality has been removed from this application as part of a system-wide simplification process.

The CaptchaVerification component now automatically passes verification without displaying any user interface, maintaining backward compatibility with any existing code that might still reference it.

If you need to implement user verification in the future, please consider using modern approaches such as:
- OAuth-based authentication
- Email verification links
- Phone number verification
- Multi-factor authentication
